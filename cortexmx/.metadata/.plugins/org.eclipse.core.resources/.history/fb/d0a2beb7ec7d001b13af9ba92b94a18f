/*
 * What is I2C?
 *
 * I2C is a protocol to achieve serial data communication between integrated circuits (ICs) which are very close to each other. It is a more serious
 * protocol than I2C because companies have come forward to design a specification for it.
 *
 * I2C protocol details (how data should be sent/received, how hand shaking should happen between sender and receiver, error handling) are more complex
 * than I2C.
 *
 * There is no dedicated spec for I2C but TI and Motorola have their own specs. I2C is based on a dedicated spec.
 *
 * I2C is multi-master capable, whereas I2C has no guidelines to achieve this, but depends on MCU designers. STM I2C peripherals can be used in multi-
 * master configurations but arbitration should be handled by software code.
 *
 * I2C hardware automatically ACKs every byte received. I2C does not support any automatic ACKing.
 *
 * I2C needs only 2 pins for communication while I2C may need 4 pins and even more if multiple slaves are involved.
 *
 * I2C master talks to slaves based on slave addresses, whereas I2C uses dedicated pins to select the slave.
 *
 * I2C is half duplex, while I2C is full duplex.
 *
 * For I2C, the max speed is 4MHz in ultra speed plus. For some STM microcontrollers, the max speed is just 400kHz. For I2C max speed, its Fpclk/2.
 * That means if the peripheral clock is 20MHz, then speed can be 10MHz.
 *
 * Slaves Control over Serial Clock:
 * In I2C, slave can make master wait by holding the clock down if its busy, thanks to clock stretching feature of I2C. But in I2C, slave has no control
 * over the clock, programmers may use their own tricks to overcome this situation.
 *
 * Data Rate:
 * Data Rate (number of bits transferred from sender to receiver in 1 sec) is much less compared to I2C.
 *
 * For example, in STM32F4x, if you have a peripheral clock of 40MHz, then with I2C you can only achieve data rate of 400Kbps compared with 20Mbps for I2C.
 *
 * SDA and SCL Signals:
 * Both SDA and SCL are bidirectional lines connected to a positive supply voltage via pullup resistors. When the bus is free, both lines are held high.
 * The output stages of devices connected to the bus must have an open-drain or open-collector configuration.
 * The bus capacitance limits the number of interfaces connected to the bus.
 *
 * I2C Modes:
 * Standard Mode		Up to 100Kbits/sec		Supported by STM32F4x
 * Fast Mode			Up to 400Kbits/sec		Supported by STM32F4x
 * Fast Mode+			Up to 1Mbits/sec		Supported by Some STM32F4x MCUs
 * High Speed Mode		Up to 3.4Mbits/sec		(not supported by F4x)
 *
 *	Start & Stop Conditions:
 *	All transactions begin with a Start(S) and are terminated by a STOP(P)
 *	A High to Low transition on the SDA line while SCL is High defines a Start condition
 *	A Low to High transition on the SDA line while SCL is High defines a Stop condition
 *
 *	The bus is considered to be busy after the START condition.
 *	The bus is considered to be free again a certain time after the STOP condition.
 *	When the bus is free another master (if present) may claim the bus.
 *	The bus stays busy if a repeated START is generated instead of a STOP condition.
 *	Most of the MCUs I2C peripherals support both master and slave mode. You need not to configure the mode because when the peripheral generates the
 *	start condition it automatically becomes the master and when it generates the stop condition it goes back to slave mode.
 *
 *	When Master gives ACK to slave, it means its ready to accept additional bytes. When Master sends NACK to slave, it indicates to slave to stop transmitting data.
 *
 *	Repeated Start Condition: (Sr) Start Again without Stop
 *	A master would do this to prevent another master from taking over the bus if it hasn't finished all communication.
 *	It is essentially a START, STOP, START without giving the chance for another master to take over in between those START conditions.
 *
 *	I2C1, I2C2, I2C3 are all on APB1 bus.
 *
 *	Required APIs:
 *	I2C Initialization
 *	I2C Master TX
 *	I2C Master RX
 *	I2C Slave TX
 *	I2C Slave RX
 *	I2C Error Interrupt Handling
 *	I2C Event Interrupt Handling
 *
 *	I2Cx Peripheral:
 *	I2C_SCLSpeed
 *	I2C_DeviceAddress
 *	I2C_ACKControl
 *	I2C_FMDutyCycle
 *
 *	Steps for I2C Init (Generic)
 *	1. Configure the Mode (standard or fast)
 *	2. Configure the speed of the serial clock (SCL)
 *	3. Configure the device address (applicable when device is slave)
 *	4. Enable the Acking
 *	5. Configure the rise time for I2C pins
 *
 *
 *	I2C Clock Stretching:
 *
 *	. Clock stretching simply means holding the clock to 0 or ground level.
 *	. The moment clock is held low, then the whole I2C interface pauses until clock is given up to its normal operation level.
 *	. I2C Devices, either master or slave, use clock stretching to slow down the communication by stretching SCL to low,
 *	  which prevents the clock to rise high again and the i2c communication stops for awhile.
 *		. There are situations where an I2C slave is not able to cooperate with the clock speed given by the master and needs to slow down a little.
 *		. If slave needs time, then it takes the advantage of clock stretching, and by holding clock at low, it pauses I2C operation.
